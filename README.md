# Web Programming 2 Honors Project
## Experimenting with GraphQL and NodeJS
The purpose of this project was to become familiar with the use of GraphQL as a querying language and its usefulness compared to regular querying languages, such and SQL. The material shown here is only in relation to how we can obtain data with GraphQL, and not how we can manipulate an actual database behind GraphQL.

For the presentation I will be displaying how GraphQL is used, what it looks like, and how to integrate it with a SQL database, specifically PostgresSQL. To serve GraphQL data I used a simple NodeJS server using express. Requests can be made to /graphql.
