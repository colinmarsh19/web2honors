# Web Programming 2 Honors Project
## Experimenting with GraphQL and NodeJS
The purpose of this project was to become familiar with the use of GraphQL as a querying language and its usefulness compared to regular querying languages, such as SQL. The material shown here is only a reflection of how to obtain data with GraphQL, and not how we can manipulate an actual database behind GraphQL. These are done with GraphQL Mutations, see: http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations.

For the presentation I will be displaying how GraphQL is used, what it looks like, and how to integrate it with a SQL database, specifically PostgresSQL. To serve GraphQL data I used a simple NodeJS server using Express. Client requests can be made to /graphql.
